      I'm a fullstack engineer based in New York City that has a background in Mathematics. My experience has given me a strong foundation in quantative analysis and problem resolution. 
      I recently completed Flatiron School's immersive bootcamp where I garnered skills in React, Ruby on Rails, SQL, and HTML/CSS.
      <br />
      <br />
      I am a problem solver, well-organized, and independent. In my free time, I'm often on the look out for the latest development in tech and science.

      Currently interested in front end and fullstack development.
